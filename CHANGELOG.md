# Changelog


## [2.1.0](https://github.com/supercharge/pipeline/compare/v2.0.0...v2.1.0) - 2020-08-xx

### Updated
- bump dependencies
- change `main` entrypoint in `package.json` to `dist` folder
- move test runner from `@hapi/lab` to `jest`
- move assertions from `@hapi/code` to `jest`

### Removed
- remove `index.js` file which acted as a middleman to export from `dist` folder


## [2.0.0](https://github.com/supercharge/numbers/compare/v1.1.0...v2.0.0) - 2020-07-27

### Added
- `isDecimal(number)` method to determine whether the given `number` is a number with decimal places
- options as the third parameters to all methods generating random integers
  - the options object currently allow the `except` property to exclude an array of numbers when generating a random number. Example: `Num.randomIntWithin(10, 20, { except: [14, 15] })`

### Updated
- move code to TypeScript to automatically generate Typings

### Breaking Changes
Well, the previous version had two similar methods (`randomInt` and `randomIntInRange`). While `randomIntInRange` accepted an options object, `randomInt` did not. The `randomInt` method was removed in favor of `randomIntWithin`.

- Renamed methods:
  - `allIntInRange` is now `allIntWithin`
  - `randomIntInRange` is now `randomIntWithin`
- removed `randomInt` method in favor of `randomIntWithin` because it has a more explicite naming


## [1.1.0](https://github.com/supercharge/numbers/compare/v1.0.0...v1.1.0) - 2020-02-11

### Added
- extend native `Number` class to make all existing Number methods available
- `.allIntInRange(min, max)` method to generate a list of integers between min and max
- `.randomIntInRange(min, max, { except = [] })` method to retrieve a random integer in range


## 1.0.0 - 2020-02-11
